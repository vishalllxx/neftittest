# Go-To-Market Strategy

NEFTIT’s launch will focus on strategic onboarding and community flywheel effects:

1. **Potential projects:**\
    Onboard good and potential web3 projects. Each project gets:
    * Campaign listing
    * NFT deployment without any efforts
    * Social media exposure

    In return, each project promotes NEFTIT, boosting early traffic and awareness.
2. **Cross-Community Growth:**\
   Campaigns from different projects attract users from multiple communities, increasing network effects and making each new campaign more visible to all.
3. **Gamified Incentives:**\
   Users are rewarded with limited-edition NFTs for completing tasks. Burn-to-upgrade and rarity mechanics make participation addictive and collectible.
4. **Platform Loyalty Features:**\
   Leaderboards, XP levels, NFT upgrades, Staking, and badges are built to retain users long-term and encourage constant participation.
5. **Airdrops & Launch Incentives:**\
   OG users, top campaign participants, and contributors will be prioritized for future rewards.
