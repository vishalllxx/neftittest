# Market Overview

#### 1. **Web3 Projects Are Struggling to Build Real Communities**

* Most early-stage Web3 projects spend **$10K–$100K+** on marketing.
* But they mostly attract **bots, airdrop hunters, or passive users**.
* Lack of smart tools to grow loyal, active, and mission-aligned communities.



**NEFTIT Insight:** We help these projects gain **real users** by giving NFT rewards in exchange for completing social/media tasks, users get value, projects get visibility.

#### 2. **Web3 Users Can't Discover Valuable Projects Easily**

* Most users scroll through random posts, missing real, promising projects.
* Existing discovery platforms are **centralized**, **not gamified**, and often **outdated**.



**NEFTIT Insight:** We offer users a **gamified discovery** experience; complete tasks, earn NFTs, and discover gems _before others_.

#### 3. **NFT Hype Is Decreasing Utility Is the Future**

* Trading volume of NFTs has dropped over **70%** from the peak (source: CryptoSlam).
* Users now want **utility-driven NFTs**, not just profile pics or hype.



**NEFTIT Insight:** Our NFTs have layered utility:

* Sell in secondary markets
* Stake for NEFT points
* Burn to upgrade into rare NFTs
* Use to gain exclusive access (OGs, campaigns, early alpha)

#### 4. **Lack of Multichain NFT Platforms With Community Integration**

* Most NFT tools/platforms focus on a **single chain**.
* They don’t offer campaigns, user rewards, or gamification.



**NEFTIT Insight:** We support **multichain NFT campaigns** – projects can choose chains (Polygon, Solana, Base, sui, etc.) and users get rewards accordingly.

#### 5. **A Massive Gap in SocialFi + DeFi + NFT Fusion**

* Web3 has grown in silos **NFT**, **DeFi**, and **SocialFi** all evolve separately.
* There’s no central experience combining all three with utility.



**NEFTIT Insight:** We are fusing all three:

* **SocialFi** → Task-based engagement
* **NFT** → Reward & utility mechanism
* **DeFi** → Staking & upgrade model with NEFT points
